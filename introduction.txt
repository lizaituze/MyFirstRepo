Brief Introduction About Myself 

My name is Ituze Joella Liza, and I am a passionate and determined individual with a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. I recently graduated from high school and have been actively building my skills in web development, particularly focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to become a software engineer who creates impactful solutions that improve lives, especially in communities that face challenges like limited access to technology.

Outside of academics, I enjoy music, basketball, and exploring creative ways to express ideas through code. I am also a quick learner and someone who adapts easily to new environments. Whether it's participating in coding bootcamps, helping others, or working on personal projects, I strive to grow every day and contribute positively to the world around me.
